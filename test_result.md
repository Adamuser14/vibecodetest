## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent to test:
- Authentication endpoints
- CRUD operations for agencies, cars, bookings
- Role-based access control
- Data validation and error handling

### Frontend Testing
Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` to test:
- User authentication flow
- Dashboard navigation
- Form submissions
- Responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Integration Testing
Test the complete user journey:
1. Super admin creates agency
2. Agency admin logs in and adds cars
3. Public user books a car
4. Agency admin views booking

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Always ask user before implementing new features
- Prioritize user-requested enhancements
- Test each new feature thoroughly before moving to next

## Notes
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- MongoDB ObjectIDs avoided in favor of UUIDs for JSON serialization
- Environment variables properly configured
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Error handling implemented throughout
